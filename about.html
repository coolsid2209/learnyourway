                        This, learn your way, is an e-learning site nade for students who can't afford to buy every books. It is not possible
                        for anyone to have variety in subjects when you choose a particular course you are stuck with a fixed subjects, but what
                        if you want to learn something other than those subjects. It is hard to find a good material, vedio lectures and test
                        series regarding the subject in one place. Hence, this gave us an idea to build a place where every person who is
                        willing to learn anything new get the best material sorted and saved all in one place.
                        Here, the reader can first look through our documentation section and find the material he/she is looking for, and then
                        decide whether to take the vedio lecture or not. To keep a momentum going you can take the quiz that has been installed
                        and will be updated every week as per the demand.
                        There is calculator and dictionary option if ever needed.
                        This platform was built so that you don't have to run around from sites to sites and waste your time in finding a proper
                        best fitted material. After all, time is money.
